Welcome! I’m **Xingyao (Doria) Xiao, Ph.D.**, a Postdoctoral Scholar at **Stanford University** Graduate School of Education. I currently work with the **LEVANTE Project** under the mentorship of Ben Domingue, Mike Frank, and Nilam Ram.

My research bridges methodological innovation with practical assessment design and large-scale data analysis. I specialize in:
* **Statistical Psychometrics**: Implementing Multidimensional IRT (mIRT) and Many-Facet Rasch Models (MFRM).
* **Bayesian Modeling**: Developing Bayesian longitudinal and latent variable models, specifically Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM).
* **AI-Integrated Measurement**: Evaluating machine learning-based scoring and the integration of large language models (LLMs) in educational assessment.

> *Methodology • Psychometrics • AI in Education*

### 🚀 Research & Projects
* **LEVANTE Project**: Contributing to the design and validation of internationalized measures for learning and development in children aged 5–12.
* **Hybrid Scoring Systems**: Investigating how scoring design and rater bias (Human vs. ML) affect latent proficiency recovery.
* **Mental Rotation Framework**: Developing tools for cognitive assessment via the levante-framework.
