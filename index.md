Welcome! [cite_start]I’m **Xingyao (Doria) Xiao, Ph.D.**, a Postdoctoral Scholar at **Stanford University** Graduate School of Education[cite: 1]. [cite_start]I currently work with the **LEVANTE Project** under the mentorship of Ben Domingue, Mike Frank, and Nilam Ram, focusing on developmental change and psychometric research[cite: 1]. 

My research bridges methodological innovation with practical assessment design and large-scale data analysis. I specialize in:
* [cite_start]**Statistical Psychometrics**: Implementing Multidimensional IRT (mIRT) and Many-Facet Rasch Models (MFRM)[cite: 1, 18, 53].
* [cite_start]**Bayesian Modeling**: Developing Bayesian longitudinal and latent variable models, specifically Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM)[cite: 1, 120].
* [cite_start]**AI-Integrated Measurement**: Evaluating machine learning-based scoring and the integration of large language models (LLMs) in educational assessment[cite: 1, 17, 287].

> *Methodology • Psychometrics • AI in Education*

### 🚀 Research & Projects
* [cite_start]**LEVANTE Project**: Contributing to the design and validation of internationalized measures for learning and development in children aged 5–12[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Hybrid Scoring Systems**: Investigating how scoring design and rater bias (Human vs. ML) affect latent proficiency recovery[cite: 4, 18, 22].
* **Mental Rotation Framework**: Developing tools for cognitive assessment via the [levante-framework](https://github.com/levante-framework/Mental-rotation.git).
* **Senior-Centered Tech**: Designing "Silver Hair" (银发产品) digital solutions for the aging population.
