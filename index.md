Welcome! [cite_start]I’m **Xingyao (Doria) Xiao, Ph.D.**, a Postdoctoral Scholar at **Stanford University** Graduate School of Education[cite: 1]. [cite_start]I currently work with the LEVANTE Project under the mentorship of Ben Domingue, Mike Frank, and Nilam Ram, focusing on developmental change and psychometric research[cite: 1]. 

[cite_start]My research bridges methodological innovation with practical assessment design and large-scale data analysis[cite: 1]. I specialize in:
* [cite_start]**Statistical Psychometrics**: Implementing Multidimensional IRT (mIRT) and Many-Facet Rasch Models (MFRM)[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Bayesian Modeling**: Developing Bayesian longitudinal and latent variable models, specifically Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM)[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**AI-Integrated Measurement**: Evaluating machine learning-based scoring and the integration of large language models (LLMs) in educational assessment[cite: 1, 17].

> *Methodology • Psychometrics • AI in Education*
