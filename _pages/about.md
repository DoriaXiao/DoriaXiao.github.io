I am a **Postdoctoral Scholar** at Stanford University (LEVANTE Project), working with Prof. **Ben Domingue** and collaborators on **developmental change**, **measurement invariance**, and **growth modeling**. 
My broader program advances **Bayesian latent variable models**, **growth mixture / latent class mixed models**, **adaptive testing (CAT)**, and **AIâ€‘assisted assessment**.

Before Stanford, I earned my **Ph.D. in Social Research Methodologies** at UC Berkeley, an **M.S. in Applied Statistics and Psychometrics** at Boston College, and a **B.A. in Statistics** at the University of Minnesota, Morris.
