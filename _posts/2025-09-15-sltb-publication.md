I’m very excited to share that our article,  
**“Trajectories of Depressive Symptom Among College Students in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Association With Suicidal Ideation and Insomnia Symptoms,”**  
has just been published in *[Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sltb.70051)* :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

This three-year, five-wave longitudinal study followed **1,387 Chinese college students** to better understand how depression evolved during the pandemic. Using **growth mixture modeling (GMM)**, we identified **five distinct trajectories** of depressive symptoms:  

- **Resilient (24%)** — consistently low symptoms  
- **Moderate-remission (46%)** — moderate but improving over time  
- **Low-increasing (20%)** — gradual worsening  
- **High-recovery (6%)** — severe early, later recovered  
- **Moderate-increasing (4%)** — moderate but worsening  

🔎 Importantly, these trajectories were not just statistical patterns — they **predicted later risks of suicidal ideation and insomnia**. Students in the increasing-symptom groups were at particularly high risk, underscoring the importance of **early identification and targeted interventions**.  

This study highlights the **heterogeneity of mental health responses** during COVID-19 and calls for more nuanced, trajectory-based approaches to supporting young people.
