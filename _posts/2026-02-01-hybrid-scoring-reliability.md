I am pleased to share that our new paper, **"Revisiting reliability with human and machine learning raters under scoring design and rater configuration in the many-facet Rasch model,"** has been published in the *British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology*.

This research, conducted with co-authors Richard J. Patz and Mark R. Wilson, investigates the psychometric impact of integrating machine learning (ML) scoring into high-stakes assessment frameworks.



### **Key Insights**

* **Systematic Bias vs. Noise:** We found that systematic rater bias, rather than random machine inconsistency, is the primary driver of estimation error in hybrid scoring systems.
* **Design Density:** Increasing scoring matrix density (moving from isolated to complete designs) significantly stabilizes latent proficiency recovery.
* **Strategic Hybridization:** Hybrid scoring yields the greatest reliability gains when human and ML raters possess **opposing biases**, allowing directional errors to cancel out.
* **Robust Modeling:** For sparse scoring designs, the Partial Credit Model (PCM) with fixed thresholds often outperforms more complex Many-Facet variants by reducing over-parameterization.

### **Practical Application**

We applied these findings to real-world data from a "Problem Solving with Math" (PSM) assessment. Results confirmed that anchoring constructed-response items to selected-response metrics can effectively stabilize scales in sparse scoring environments.
