Yesterday I had the honor of presenting my dissertation,  
**“When Growth Mixture Models Break,”** as a talk in the [**BEAR Seminar**](https://events.berkeley.edu/educ/event/304585-bear-seminar-when-growth-mixture-models-break) at the School of Education, University of California, Berkeley.  

I am deeply grateful to the **Social Research Methodologies (SRM) cluster**—my mentors, colleagues, and friends—who have shaped and supported me throughout this journey.  

The surprise celebration, complete with an SRM-themed cake 🎂, flowers 🌹, and cap 🎓, made the day even more special.  

Proud to be an **SRM Bear 🐻**, and excited to continue this work as I begin the next chapter at **Stanford**!
